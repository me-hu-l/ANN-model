# ANN-model  

This is the final project we did as a group in the systems biology course CH6330

The dataset used which is the cytosolic calcium level are provided for various cells in the excel file-

The model is a framework for selectiing an appropriate ANN(Artificial Neural Network) structure for reliably predicting the ion level  using the sliding window model, as well as by analysing other parameters such as train-test data split, and changing the number of nuerons or layers in ANN etc.
